## Hi, I'm Dean Ukanah

<!--

**Harrylever/Harrylever** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:


I am a Full Stack Engineer specialized in building highly scalable, responsive, and user-friendly web applications. These days, I primarily work with Next.js, React, and TypeScript. I am well-versed and experienced in a variety of technology stacks, including JavaScript, Python, Django, and Bash.
In addition to coding, I give technical talks, provide career advice, and manage an active [tech community](https://chat.whatsapp.com/JVPIw3QnWMsFoeWnMM5Dzy). Currently, I enjoy building projects both for fun and work. In my free time, I play chess and watch Solo leveling.
