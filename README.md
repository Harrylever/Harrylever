Mastering Python for Data Science and Ethical Hacking. I love Typescript a lot, with React-JS, Next-JS and Node-JS framework projects, although I am not completely into it as I am with Python.

I play games till Dawn when I play games. I could say that I am a chess student, but I find it very hard. I have an objective, which is to be a well-rounded developer, one who can tackle any problem with no constraints, as I currently have basic knowledge of Java and C language and still learning more...

I love to collaborate on open source projects.
