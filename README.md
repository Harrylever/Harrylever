I am a Full Stack Engineer specializing in building highly scalable, responsive, and user-friendly web applications. These days, I primarily work with Next.js, React, and TypeScript. I am well-versed and experienced in a variety of technology stacks, including JavaScript, Python, Django, and Bash.
In addition to coding, I give technical talks, provide career advice, and manage an active [tech community](https://chat.whatsapp.com/G29pIK9Kg4G44uMhxmuBdZ). Currently, I enjoy building projects both for fun and work. In my free time, I play chess and watch Solo leveling ðŸ˜Ž.
